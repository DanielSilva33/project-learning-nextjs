# Project-learning-nextjs

This project was made for learning in Next js, following the Next own documentation.
In this project I used knowledge such as 'Static Generation, and Server-side Rendering', and I hosted this website at Vercel, which we managed to integrate this quickly and simply.
All code is available for use and modifications.

To run the project just:
1 - Clone the project;

2 - Download the facilities;

3 - In the 'npm run dev' terminal, which will open your project on localhost.
